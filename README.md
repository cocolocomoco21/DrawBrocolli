# Draw Brocolli
## Preface
This is OLD code, written around December 2014, within the first year of me writing my first line of code. It is (probably) "bad" code, doesn't work properly, broccoli is spelled incorrectly, and heck, it probably even uses Java 7. However, in the spirit of showing my progress as a developer, documenting and acknowledging where I came from, and leaning-in to the stereotypical early CS student enthusiasm, I'd like to publicly showcase one of my earliest personal projects.

## Name
The inspiration for this project is when a friend and I were studying in the library. Being a non-CS student, she curioiusly asked "What are programs actually? What do programs really do?". My response was something along the lines of "Well, programs can and do whatever you want, and whatever you tell them to do. For instance, I could make a program that.... draws.. broccoli!". And for the sake of a joke, I decided to actually make the project. 

## Overview
Again, despite the upload date, this code is OLD! It is here for documentation purposes, however it is still a fond repo of mine. DrawBrocolli, one of my first side projects, attempts to do exactly that: draw broccoli (notice the spelling mistake - but at least I'm consistent). 

DrawBrocolli is an Eclipse console-based program (of course). Is a project really an early CS student project if it isn't a bunch of for-loops printing in an Eclipse console app? The user inputs the size of the board, and the program allows the user to either manually draw their own broccoli, or have the program draw the broccoli for them. The thing is, the drawing for them part doesn't work at all. It's a best effort attempt and will not be updated. Sorry to anyone who wants an accurate brocolli drawn for them :(. You can always draw it yourself!

## Running
I don't know why you'd want to run this. Don't run this. Please. But, if you really feel the need, you should be able to do it from a terminal or through Eclipse.

## Roadmap
None. Why are you reading this far?

## Misc
Thanks for checking this out!
